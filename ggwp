Error checklist:

• Memory corruption? (Valgrind)

• Integer overflow? (compile with -ftrapv)

• Implicit type conversions? (compile with -Wconversion)

• Divides by zero (or small numbers in floating point code)?

• Correct output for large (near limits) testcases?

• Fast enough (both theoretical and practical)?

• Output entirely to spec? (whitespace! and string output)
